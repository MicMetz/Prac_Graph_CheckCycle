# Data Structures Practice - Graph - Check For Cycles


Write C++ code that goes through a Binary Search Tree and deletes every leaf node with an odd
key value. Your function should display the key values of each node of the tree, starting with the
left child, then the right child, before displaying the root of each subtree. The nodes that are
being deleted should display the key with a message “deleting” next to the key value. Your code
should prevent any potential memory leaks.
